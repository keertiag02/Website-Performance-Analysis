# Website-Performance-Analysis
<h3>Analyzed website performance using MS Excel, dataset including 5500+ visitor records, and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends.</h3>
<p><b>Analyzed following information:</b>
<ol>
<li>60% are new visitors and 40% are returning visitors.</li> 
<li>Higher engagement is from social media compared to referral, direct, and organic sources (with only 1-2% variation among them).</li>
<li>Maximum new visitors exit from the product page, this may be due to the high price of the products, while maximum returning visitors exit from the checkout page and contact us page.</li>
<li>Overall the website is uniform (uniform exit page intensity, 20-21%).</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b>Recommendations:</b>
<ul>
<li>The website needs to work on its designing (frontend) to interact more users. It should be more informative and clear so that the visitors can relate to it.</li>
<li>The website needs to showcase the product in an attractive manner and the website must give more detailing and specifications about the products.</li> 
<li>The website needs to work on its marketing strategies to attract more visitors.</li>
<li>The website can take reviews and feedback from the visitors and work on it.</li>
</ul>
