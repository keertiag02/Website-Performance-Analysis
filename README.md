# Website-Performance-Analysis
Analyzed website performance dataset of 5500+ visitor records, including their visitor ID, location, bounce rate, conversion rate, session duration, load time, page views, exit page, using MS Execl and built an interactive Power BI dashboard

Identified that 60% are new visitors and 40% are returning visitors. Higher engagement is from social media compared to referral, direct, and organic sources (with only 1-2% variation among them). Overall the website is uniform (uniform exit page intensity, 20-21%).
Thus, the website needs to work on it. The website needs to work on its designing (frontend) to interact more users. It should be more informative and clear so that the visitors can relate to it.

Since, maximum new visitors exit from the product page, this may be due to the high price of the products, while maximum returning visitors exit from the checkout page and contact us page. In such case, the website needs to give more detailing and specifications about the product. The website must showcase the product in an attractive manner. 

The website can take reviews and feedback from the visitors and work upon it.
